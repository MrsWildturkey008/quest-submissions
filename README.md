### 1. Blockchain is an open database that stores its information into chunks/blocks. These blocks then builds upon itself and are linked together like a chain. Anyone can interact and view the data. No single person owns or controls blockchain. Once you have submitted the information on blockchain it is usually irreversible and difficult to change or hack.

### 2. A Smart Contract is a specific set of rules that people can interact with. Smart contracts are extremely secure and fast due to not having to wait to get approval from a middle-man.

### 3. The differences between script and a transaction are the cost and how it's being used. Script is used to view data on the blockchain and it's free, while transaction changes the data on the blockchain and costs money.
